# Udacity Reviwer
Dashboard app for Udacity Reviewer's with status, queue and Push Notifications

App needs Udacity token registration
# Steps to register
1. Install app
2. Get the `FCM_TOKEN`
3. Run [this fork](https://github.com/kartikarora/grading-assigner) of Udacity Grading Assigner script with additional parameter `--fcm-token FCM_TOKEN`. This is not a replacement of the Udacity Reviews API token. Both the tokens are required.
4. App gets configured automatically if everything was done properly
